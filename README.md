# DAILY SHEETS

## Purpose
To create an electronic daily sheet system to facilitate data exchange between parents and daycare providers. A daycare provider can add and update data for a child such as how much they ate, when their diaper was changed, and what activities they did that day. Then parents/guardians would be able to view that data for their child(ren).
