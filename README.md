# DAILY SHEETS

Here's a 
![Gif of completed project](/src/assets/images/completed-gif.gif)

## Purpose
To create an electronic daily sheet system to facilitate data exchange between parents and daycare providers. A daycare provider can add and update data for a child such as how much they ate, when their diaper was changed, and what activities they did that day. Then parents/guardians would be able to view that data for their child(ren).   

The idea for this project came while watching my own son's daycare teachers trying to manage a dozen+ half-sheets of paper on a clipboard on a windy day out on the playground as several parents waited for them to find their particular child's sheet.
