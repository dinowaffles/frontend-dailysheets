## ERD Diagram
Each daily sheet will belong to only one student. However, students will have a new daily sheet for each day they are present at daycare. Each student will belong to only one classroom, but each classroom will have many students.

## Wireframes
The daycare admin would have access to view, update, delete, and create both students and classrooms. The teachers at the daycare would be able select a classroom from the dropdown menu, then see a list of students in the sidebar. The bulk of the teacher view is dedicated to areas where they can update what the child did that day. The parent/guardian view is similar to that of teacher, but they can only view the data that has already been entered.
